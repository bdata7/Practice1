# Overview

The 'run_analysis.R' script will extract the mean and standard deviation variables from signals obtained in the dataset 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'.  Then, the average of each variable per activity and subject is tabulated in a text file called 'run_analysis.txt'.

# Executing the Script

Prior to executing the script, the UCI HAR Dataset folder must be downloaded and unzipped from the link 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'.  This folder should be placed in your working directory.

You may then run the 'run_analysis.R' script.  This script will transform the UCI HAR Dataset to yield a tidy dataset product as a textfile called 'run_analysis.txt'.  

A list of the files used to create the tidy dataset along with a description of the variables, signals, and activities can be found in the attached CodeBook.md file.
